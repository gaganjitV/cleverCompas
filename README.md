Crypto Knights - Tutoring Website Backend
Technology License: MIT
User Story
AS an administrator of a tutoring platform,
I WANT a backend for the Crypto Knights website that leverages the latest technologies,
SO THAT students and tutors can efficiently manage sessions, track progress, and communicate seamlessly.

Description
This project involves developing the backend for the Crypto Knights tutoring website using Express.js and Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database. The backend functionality supports retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting user profiles, session schedules, and progress reports, ensuring a smooth user experience for both tutors and students.

Video Demo of Operations: Coming Soon!
What I Learned
I deepened my understanding of backend API methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE and how they interact with databases to handle dynamic user and session data.

Usage
The backend provides essential functionality to manage the tutoring website:

User Profiles: Create, view, update, and delete tutor and student accounts.
Session Management: Schedule, modify, and delete tutoring sessions.
Progress Tracking: Record and retrieve student learning progress.
This ensures that the Crypto Knights platform operates smoothly and meets the needs of both tutors and students.
